// Seeding data in a database refers to the process of populating a database with initial data. 

// Here we store data in form of Materialized view in the database.
// A materialized view in a database is a database object that contains the results of a query. Unlike regular views, which are virtual tables computed on demand, materialized views store the query result physically and can be periodically refreshed. This makes them particularly useful for improving query performance on large datasets where the underlying data doesn't change frequently.
